# TypeScript recap

TypeScript is a super set of javascript which is strongly typed.

# Running TS Code

1. Compile(tsc) TypeScript files and then run in Node or in the Browser.
2. Use ts-node to execute and run TypeScript files directly in Node. (only for dev)
3. Bundle with Webpack and run in the browser (React has built in webpack).
